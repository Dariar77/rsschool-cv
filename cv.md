### About:
I am 16, I am finishing school (grade 11) and looking for my stable occupation. Graduated from "UPK" and received a diploma of "Master in Digital Information Processing". This institution gave me a lot of knowledge in different fields. I learned how to design business cards, leaflets, studied the database, and most importantly, they showed me the basics of frontend development. I know HTML, CSS, some JS, also worked with bootstrap and figma. I liked this area and that is why I have a great desire to take this course
